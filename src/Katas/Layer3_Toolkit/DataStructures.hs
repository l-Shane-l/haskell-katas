-- Goal: Learn when to use which data structure
-- Each function should use the MOST APPROPRIATE data structure

-- === PART 1: Choosing the Right Structure ===

{- | Count word frequencies in text
Hint: What structure is best for lookups and updates?
-}
wordFrequencies :: String -> [(String, Int)]
wordFrequencies = undefined

{- | Find all unique elements (remove duplicates)
Hint: What structure handles uniqueness?
-}
unique :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
unique = undefined

{- | Implement a queue with O(1) enqueue and dequeue
Hint: Lists are O(n) for append...
-}
data Queue a = Queue -- Your implementation

enqueue :: a -> Queue a -> Queue a
enqueue = undefined

dequeue :: Queue a -> Maybe (a, Queue a)
dequeue = undefined

{- | Random access: get nth element efficiently
List is O(n), what's O(1)?
-}
getNth :: Int -> [Int] -> Maybe Int
getNth = undefined -- Don't use lists!

-- === PART 2: Text and ByteString ===

{- | Efficient string processing
String is [Char] (linked list!), what's better?
-}
efficientConcat :: [String] -> String
efficientConcat = undefined -- Don't use ++

{- | Process large file content
String loads whole file as list of Char. Better?
-}
countLines :: FilePath -> IO Int
countLines = undefined

-- === PART 3: Maps and Sets ===

{- | Graph representation: adjacency list
Map each node to its neighbors
-}
type Graph a = undefined -- Choose the right structure

addEdge :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> Graph a -> Graph a
addEdge = undefined

neighbors :: (Ord a) => a -> Graph a -> [a]
neighbors = undefined

-- | Set operations
intersection :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a] -> [a]
intersection = undefined -- Don't use list functions!

-- === PART 4: Sequences ===

{- | Implement an undo/redo system
Need efficient access to both ends
-}
data UndoRedo a = UndoRedo -- Your implementation

doAction :: a -> UndoRedo a -> UndoRedo a
doAction = undefined

undo :: UndoRedo a -> Maybe (a, UndoRedo a)
undo = undefined

redo :: UndoRedo a -> Maybe (a, UndoRedo a)
redo = undefined

-- === PART 5: Vectors ===

{- | Matrix multiplication (2D arrays)
Lists would be O(n) per access!
-}
type Matrix = undefined -- Choose the right structure

matrixMultiply :: Matrix -> Matrix -> Matrix
matrixMultiply = undefined

{- | Running statistics on numeric data
Calculate mean, min, max in one pass
-}
stats :: [Double] -> (Double, Double, Double)
stats = undefined -- Convert to better structure?

-- === PART 6: Specialized Structures ===

{- | Phone book: Int keys (phone numbers)
Map Int is good, but there's something better...
-}
type PhoneBook = undefined

addPhone :: Int -> String -> PhoneBook -> PhoneBook
addPhone = undefined

{- | Cache with string keys (e.g., URLs)
String keys need hashing...
-}
type Cache a = undefined

cacheInsert :: String -> a -> Cache a -> Cache a
cacheInsert = undefined

-- === PART 7: Performance Comparison ===

{- | Benchmark different structures for your use case
Return (build time, lookup time) in milliseconds
-}
benchmarkLookup :: Int -> (Double, Double)
benchmarkLookup n = undefined

-- Build structure with n elements
-- Time 1000 random lookups
-- Compare: List, Map, HashMap, Vector

-- === PART 8: Real-World Patterns ===

-- | Implement a simple in-memory database
data Database = Database -- Your design

-- Support:
-- - Insert record (with unique ID)
-- - Update record
-- - Delete record
-- - Query by ID (fast!)
-- - Query by field (full scan OK)

insertRecord :: Record -> Database -> Database
insertRecord = undefined

queryById :: Int -> Database -> Maybe Record
queryById = undefined

queryByField :: String -> String -> Database -> [Record]
queryByField fieldName value db = undefined

data Record = Record
  { recordId :: Int
  , fields :: [(String, String)]
  }
  deriving (Show, Eq)
